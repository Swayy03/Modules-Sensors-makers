This document will contain most specifications for creating your own DIY_FLEX_SENSOR using cheap material. Credits to https://www.instructables.com/How-to-Make-FLEX-Sensor-at-Home-DIY-Flex-Sensor/
For part(most) of this logic

What You Need
1. Cardboard(Book Cover hardness) 
2. Aluminium foil or tin foil
3. Pencil --preferrably of B series but doesn't matter though :)
4. Office Glue
5. Hot glue--Also optional as long as it binds things together
6. 2 female end jumper wires --could M to F or F TO F -- could as well use male ended
7. Sheet of plain paper(print paper)
8. A multimeter(Optional)


Procedure of making

1. Cut the cardboard to size -15cm by 2cm --x2(2 pieces)
2. Take a bigger roll of the aluminium foil and crample it, this will help make the flex sensor more sensitive and reactive
3. Cut the crampled aluminium/tin foil to size -10cm by 1.5cm --x2 (2 pieces)
4. Crample a larger piece of plain paper....this will help sensitivity as well.
5. cut the plain paper to same size of the carboard or rather just bigger than the crampled aluminium foil. 
6. Glue the aluminium foil pieces to the cardboard pieces and place them strategically in the middle.
7. Cut the jumper wire to desirable size and glue the exposed wire ends to the different aluminium foil pieces.
8. If you have a multimeter, measure the continuity of the aluminium foil to the other end of the wire that is not glued to the foil. I repeat!!! Do step 8 at least twice to prevent wastage of material
	else: You will find out if everything if properly set up later > <
9. Using the pencil, rub graphite all over the plain paper piece as if to color it. The more graphite on the better. If you have B series pencil, use that.If you don't...no worries
10. Place the piece of graphited(sorry) paper in the middle of the two cardboard-foil pieces without gluing it as well
11. Glue the carboard ends together making sure not to glue the piece of paper as well.
12. Test....code coming later

--I am personally not done with research on the best way using physics to optimize it. May drop a better DIY Flex sensor later..
